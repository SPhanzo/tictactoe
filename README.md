paste code, start game, does not have a hard-coded win function so you just decide who wins
That's probably the only charm it has. 
The other charm is that it'd be comparable to a paper and pencil type of tic tac toe and you could also play after one person winning just like trying to win after they already won (something like that)
in order to start again you just press exit and run the code again.
